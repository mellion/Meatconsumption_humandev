# Data Project: Meat Consumption and Human Development

## Introduction
This project aims to analyze the relationship between meat consumption and human development for various countries. We have collected data on meat consumption and Human Development Index (HDI) for multiple countries and years. The dataset includes information on different types of meat consumed (beef, poultry, and pork) and various aspects of human development (HDI index, life expectancy, mean schooling years, and income per capita).

## Data Cleaning
The data for this project is stored in two main tables: meatconsumption and hdi_data. The meatconsumption table contains information about meat consumption in different countries, while the hdi_data table contains information on the human development aspects of the same countries. These tables are joined based on the country code to create a combined table meat_consumption_and_dev.

We have also performed data cleaning tasks like renaming tables, updating column names, and removing unnecessary records (such as records with future projected years or unneeded categories like 'EU27', 'BRICS', 'OECD').

The final dataset consists of 11,203 records and 35 unique country codes after cleaning.


## Data Visualization
Using Power BI, we have created visualizations to explore the data further. Some of the visuals include:

A map of countries by total meat consumption
A stacked bar chart showing the most popular meat types by country
A scatterplot comparing HDI index and meat consumption
A table visual displaying the most consumed meat by countries with the lowest HDI
A table visual showing the highest income per capita countries by meat preference
## Conclusion
The project provided insights into the relationship between meat consumption and human development. The correlation analysis showed a weak positive correlation between HDI index and meat consumption. The strongest link was found between beef consumption and income per capita.

Further analysis revealed the most and least meat-consuming countries and the most popular meat types in different countries. The project also explored the most consumed meat in countries with the lowest HDI and the highest income per capita countries by meat preference.

The visualizations created using Power BI allowed us to have a better understanding of the data and facilitated the communication of findings.
